## Fork differences

Unknow horizons is an open-source 2D game real time strategy simulation mainly inspired by the Anno series with an emphasis on economy and city building. You can expand your small settlement to a strong and wealthy colony, collect taxes and supply your inhabitants with valuable goods. And increase your power with a well balanced economy and with strategic trade and diplomacy.

This version differ by the fact it is a ticks based game, this mean events will follow a clock. You can see it like turn in a board game, but automatic. Instead of a real time strategy simulation, by example the resource production in each building and their transport in real time, each tick: all the game is updated. When you play game like anno, 4X, or other city builder, you are often inscrease time speed by 3 or 4, to avoid waiting because real time is too slow. It will not happen with this ticks system, because in 1 tick you can produce, buy or sell resources. Also, it will reduce the huge amount of work needed to create a simulation. Plus it permits to increase performances ! And yes, we will use magic (maths), to make things moving on screens like it was on real time.
